## How does cloud computing work?

Cloud computing stores and processes information over the internet instead of relying on a local hard drive to store the data. 

Uploading to a cloud over local storage accomplishes 2 benefits.

  - It can store and process much larger amounts of information faster.
  - It can deliver results to any device that has an internet connection, not restricted to a device or set of local terminals.


## Examples of cloud services:

  - Netflix, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Online, iTunes, etc...


As long as a service doesn’t require you to be physically close to the storage hardware, it can deliver information to you from the cloud. Deposit a check through your phone? Upload a photo for your friends?  You’re in the cloud!


## Cloud services take 3 forms:

### Public clouds share storage and computing space
Public clouds are owned and operated by companies that offer their customers rapid access to affordable computing resources. This is the classic cloud computing model, in which small businesses and individuals like you can access a lot of computing power over the Internet. It’s easy to scale when users need more power or storage. Because many users are working inside one large bank of information but their data must be kept separate and secure, this kind of cloud is organized by what’s called multi-tenant architecture.

### Private clouds protect a single entity’s information
A private cloud is operated for a single organization. It can be hosted and managed either by that organization or by a provider, and its servers can reside either inside or outside the organization itself. Of course, this privacy also means that as a private cloud’s data expands, the organization has to install more and more private servers. Organizations prefer a private cloud if they need tight control over where their data is being held, how it is organized, and how it is protected. Private clouds can be very secure—but they are expensive!

### Hybrid clouds divide their storage into private slices
What if a business needs the low cost and scalability of a public cloud, but also needs a secure environment for product development or confidential data? These organizations wind up spreading their workloads across data centers, private clouds, and public clouds—thereby creating hybrid clouds.

A hybrid cloud mixes public and private resources. It’s a bit of this and a bit of that, with some data in a public cloud, and some in a private cloud, provided by multiple vendors who offer different levels of cloud usage. A hybrid cloud’s combination of physical and virtual servers allows organizations to rent what they need, on demand, helping them control costs while providing some flexibility.
